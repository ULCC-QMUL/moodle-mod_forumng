This script describes steps to test the userposts facility from a user
perspective. It is intended to cover mainly the use of the 'Posts rated by others@ display option.

NOTE: In this test case, the word 'forum' always refers to the OU ForumNG.

The test steps in this script follow on from each other and aren't independent.

Initial setup
=============

This test case requires:

- a course
- one test course enrolled student user (U.S1).
- one editing teacher with manager role on course (U.ET)

The test server must have debugging set to DEVELOPER level and to display
errors; during all parts of the test script, there should be no debugging
warnings.
